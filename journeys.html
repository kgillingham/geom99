                Shackleton's Antarctic Expedition
            </h1>
            <p1>
                On December 5 1914, the ship Endurance left the shores of South Georgia, carrying Ernest Shackleton and his crew of 27 men. Early in 1915, 'Endurance' 
                became trapped in the ice, and ten months later sank. Shackleton's crew had already abandoned the ship to live on the floating ice. In April 1916, they 
                set off in three small boats, eventually reaching Elephant Island. Taking five crew members, Shackleton went to find help. In a small boat, the six 
                men spent 16 days crossing 1,300 km of ocean to reach South Georgia and then trekked across the island to a whaling station. The remaining men from the 
                'Endurance' were rescued in August 1916. Not one member of the expedition died.

                An Authentic Marathon
            </h1>
            <p1>
                The marathon course is based on the legend from which the race gained its name: Pheidippides, a messenger in Ancient Greece, ran from the Battle of Marathon to 
                Athens to announce the Greeks' victory over the Persians. It is perhaps the most difficult major marathon race: the course is uphill from the 10 km mark to 
                the 31 km mark – the toughest uphill climb of any major marathon. The course begins in the town of Marathon, where it passes the tomb of the Athenian soldiers, 
                and it traces a path near the coast through Nea Makri. Following the steep rise, the course goes lightly downhill towards the city of Athens. It passes a 
                statue of a runner in the city centre before finishing up at the Panathinaiko Stadium; a site for athletics competitions in ancient times and the 
                finishing point for both the 1896 and 2004 Olympic marathons.

                Northwest Passage Expeditions
            </h1>
            <p1>
                Their routes through the Arctic in search of a northwest sea passage were remarkably similar, but their fates could not have been more different. 
                Though Sir John Franklin was a celebrated English explorer with decades of experience, 128 men, and two finely crafted ships, his mission became 
                tragically trapped in ice. A half-century later, a young, comparatively inexperienced Norwegian named Roald Amundsen, using a modest fishing vessel 
                and a tiny crew, charted the long-sought Northwest Passage with relative ease. On this interactive map, compare key points on both expeditions and 
                follow their routes from beginning to end.
